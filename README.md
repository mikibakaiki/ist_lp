This project is about making a Sudoku puzzle solver, using a specific algorithm - every position that is empty gets a list of all possible numbers and from there, the program just tries each of those numbers in each position, until a solution is found.

**Grades:** 
* Code test and execution: 15 / 16; (last test was about efficiency, and my program was a bit slow :)
* Code and comment quality: 4 / 4;
* Total : 19 / 20.
